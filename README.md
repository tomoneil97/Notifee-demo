# Notifee-demo
Demo app for notifee library local notifications

Run 'yarn' to install dependencies

Run pod install

On Apple Silicon? Use arch -x86_64 pod install instead of pod install. Then ensure that there are no issues with the packages in XCode. You may need to select a Signing Team for a couple of pods that kick up a fuss when you're trying to build the app.

Run the app on an iOS simulator with 'yarn ios'
